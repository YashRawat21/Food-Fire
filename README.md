<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Two types of Export/Import

- Default Export/Import

export default Component;
import Component from "path"


- Named Export/Import

export const Component;
import {Component} from "path";

# React Hooks
- useState() -> superpowerful state variable in react.
- useEffect() 

- we have to import useState as named Import.
- useState helps to maintain the state of component.
- whenever the state variable update , react re-render the component. 

# Shimmer UI
- basically we load a fake page until we get data from API.
- if we want to various shimmer ui cards then;
- Array.from({length:15}).map((el) => return {
    <div classname = "shimmer-card"></div>
})
- above array.from method will create a array of length 15 and will return 15 simmer card;

# Routing in Web App 
- There are two types of Routing in Web App 
- Client Side Routing
- Server Side Side Routing 

- Server Side Routing -> is that when we made a network call and that page u have called is coming from server.

- Client Side Routing -> is that when we don't make a network call.

# React is a single page application 
- React is a single page application becoz it's just one page and component just get interchanged via Client Side Routing.
